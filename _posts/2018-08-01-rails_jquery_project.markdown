Getting familiar with JQuery and how it integrates with Ruby on Rails to me was like playing Black Jack.   Some days I felt like I spent hours and went nowhere with a problem or a bug, simply saying "Hit me" in the google search engine hoping to find the  answer and getting dealt that card that just puts you over 21. So close...  Other days, I'd find just what I needed to put together a working solution that beat the dealer.  

One project down, one more to go.
