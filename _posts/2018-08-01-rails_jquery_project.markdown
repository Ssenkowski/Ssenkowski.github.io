The project was an integration my Ruby on rails project  with JavaScript/ Jquery  client-side interaction.   The goal was to take my original territory app and create a more intuitive experience  using the Javascript Jquery library.     To start with I had to  see which features of JavaScript needed to be included.   A breakdown of the project requirements was needed  followed by rough drafts of a plan where these features would have the most impact on a user's experience and what methods might be used into implement these features.  

Getting familiar with JQuery and how it integrates with Ruby on Rails was at times like playing Black Jack.   Some days I felt like I spent hours and went nowhere with a problem ( Facebook's Omniauth and ".fetch()"  caused authentication errors), simply saying "Hit me" in the google search engine hoping to find the  answer and getting dealt that card that just puts you over 21. So close...  Other days, I'd find just what I needed to put together a working solution that beat the dealer.  Needless to say the specific details of the plan changed a couple times throughout the process.   Sometimes out of necessity, other times out of personal preference.    

 All in all, I'm happy with how it turned out and will probably continue to add and change features and styles of the application.
