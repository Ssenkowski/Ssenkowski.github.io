I mainly chose software engineering because it seems to offer more stability and flexability than most jobs.    With moderation and balance being in short supply coding and programming seem to offer an excellent way to maintain those values.    Technology and software has also made such a positive impact on so many people's lives that the cost of learning engineering, languages and code is very miniscule compared to the results.  So I'm excited to be here at Flatiron, to be learning so I can make a better impact on those around to me.
