Scope is what a particular person, place or thing has access to and whatever abilities it has to use that knowledge.  An architect knows how to design, a chef knows how to cook, a writer knows how to write these abilities and the knowledge needed to do them is all within their *scope*.   Computers and web applications are the same way.      Scope then is just another fancy term for what something knows and what it can do.   

The app Yelp, for example, is able to find local restaurants, events, coffee shops and even show you detailed information about these things because it's been programmed to be within Yelp's scope.  Yelp however cannot access your bank account, your homeowners insurance or start your car remotely, it's out of scope.  Applications like yelp are broken down into smaller parts that each have their own scope which also are made of smaller parts that know and do certain things and the things get gradually smaller and smaller and the scope narrows.

In programming, specifically Ruby, scope has to do with where declared variables and methods are available in the code.
