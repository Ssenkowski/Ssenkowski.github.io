I mainly chose software engineering because it seems to offer more stability and flexability than most jobs.    With moderation and balance being in short supply coding and programming seem to offer an excellent way to maintain those values.    Technology and software has also made such a positive impact on so many people's lives that the value of learning engineering, new languages, code and how to use it ethically is great.  So I'm excited to be here at Flatiron, to meet everyone, to learn this trade and to ultimately find a great job.
