Scope is what a particular person, place or thing has access to and whatever abilities it has to use that knowledge.    Scope is just another fancy term for what you know and what you can do.   An architect knows how to design, a chef knows how to cook, a writer knows how to write these abilities and the knowledge needed to do them is all within their *scope*.   Computers and web applications are the same way.  

For example, the Yelp app is able to find local restaurants, events, coffee shops and much more because all these things are within it's scope.  Yelp however cannot access your bank account, your homeowners insurance or start your car remotely, it's out of scope.  Applications like yelp are broken down into smaller parts that each have their own scope.   

In programming, specifically Ruby, scope has to do with where declared variables and methods are available in the code.
