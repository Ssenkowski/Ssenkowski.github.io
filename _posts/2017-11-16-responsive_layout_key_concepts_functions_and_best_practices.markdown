        Responsive layout can keep websites functional and appealing.   When its used effectively software developers create dynamic websites that respond to user interfaces regardless of the viewing field.  Programmers that develop effective layouts give the user an experience that encourages them to come back.  I don't know yet if this is true but it's my guess that most users likely quickly notice whether a site is equipped with a well designed responsive layout, they either just don't know what it's called or who's responsible for it.  So whether we get recognized for it or not as a programmer if they've never recognized poor responsive layout we want to keep it that way and if they have, we want to give them that experience they should have had the first time.

###### Easy to use.  Appealing to look at regardless of the viewers screen or window size.
