 I feel like this project drastically improved my understanding of Sinatra and itâ€™s concepts and my comfort level. Prior to the project I felt like I was going from one lab to the next and the concepts made sense but a couple days later I was struggling with them.  This time through I gave myself a little extra rest, reviewed a few days and took the weekend almost completely off from thinking about it.  Then Tuesday morning I started the project by really partitioning out what I wanted my app to do, how each Model, Controller and View would fit into the project and what they would accomplish before diving in.   That made a WORLD of a difference.  When a problem or error did come up I felt I could figure it out or search for it and adjust other suggestions to fit or pry my way into the code and make it work.  I was having fun!
