I was in complete admiration of another student's project today.    They listed out a few things that they thought helped, so here were a few things I took away from the experience:

1. If you want to be a successful programmer work like one.  Put in the long hours and the effort.  Review, refactor and research your code.  After your done you'll thank yourself regardless of whether anyone else does. 
2.  Develop a healthy sense of pride and accomplishment with what you're doing.   If you're not treating what you're working on like you'd treat your families priceless heir loom it's probably not going to be your best.  Careful, determined, well planned out, focused work makes for an abundance of real success.  
3.  Don't leave room for regrets.  Just do it!   Refactor the models, controllers and views and customize the HTML and CSS.  If there's any chance you want your program to top the charts.
4.  Get help.  Ask around, people in the software community want to help each other.
5.  Learn.
