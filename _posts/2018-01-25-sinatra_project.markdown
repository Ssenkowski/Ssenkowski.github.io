I was in complete admiration of another student's project today.    They listed out a few things that they thought helped, so here were a few things I took away from the experience:

1. If you want to be a successful programmer work like one.  Put in the long hours and the effort.  Review, refactor and research your code.  
2.  Develop a healthy sense of pride and accomplishment with what you're doing.   If you're not treating your project with a high regard chances are it's going to fall flat.  Careful, determined, well planned out, focused work makes for real success.  
3.  Don't leave room for regrets.    Look for ways to improve and use them.
4.  Get help.  Ask around, people in the software community want to help each other.
5.  Learn.
