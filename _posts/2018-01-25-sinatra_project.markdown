I was in complete admiration of another student's project today.    They listed out a few things that they thought helped them, but here were a few things I took away from the experience.  First, If you want to be a successful programmer work like one.  Put in the long hours and effort of reviewing, refactoring and researching your code after your done you'll thank yourself whether anyone else does.  Second, develop a healthy sense of pride and accomplishment with what you're doing.   If you're not treating what you're working on like you'd treat your families priceless heir loom it's probably not going to be your best.  Careful, determined, well planned out, focused work makes for an abundance of real success.  Third, don't leave room for regrets.  Just do it!   Refactor the models, controllers and views and customize the HTML and CSS. You want your program to top the web app charts.
