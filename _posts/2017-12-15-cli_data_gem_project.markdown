Until starting Flatiron's school about 2 months ago "command lines interfaces" we're a thing of the 80's and 90's found in Hollywood movies like *Jurassic Park* and *War Games*.  I never even crossed my mind that I would create a CLI Data Gem that involved creating if else conditionals, gemfiles, rakefiles and binfiles or instance methods that take arguements of converted user inputs to select an element from a class array that was scraped from a public website so that someone could download this ruby gem to find out what events were happening at the Cleveland Art Museum and learn a little about each event.   2 months ago I would have had no idea what likely any of that even meant.  So getting to feel my comfort level increase with all of the aspects of Object Oriented Ruby programming feels great.   These coding tools (pry, conditionals, classes, methods, *self*, irb) are all becoming part of my programming "toolbox", (which I have a feeling will turn into a "tool shed").   Hopefully when the project review comes I'll have to do some refactoring.  

It may not be much but I am proud I could get something like this working.  Hopefully a few days from now after the project is reviewed and refactored it'll work and look better and I'll have possibly even a better grasp of all the larger and smaller details and concepts involved in this project.
