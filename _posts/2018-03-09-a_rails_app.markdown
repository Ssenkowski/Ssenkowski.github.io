 I do a lot of work during the year helping a congregation manage territories for a volunteer work so that the work can take place in an organized way.  The RAILS_TERRITORY_APP  was designed to help administrators manage these congregation territories and to help publishers find the process using them easy.  I was hoping to do this in two simple ways
 
1.  Make territories downloadable to the publishers in the field via a web app 

2.   Allow territory administrators to track publishers efforts and the flow of territories.


  The app works simply.   A publisher or administrator is invited to sign up and is then immediately linked to the publisher's new page and asked to create a publisher account that links with their user account.  This allows privileges to be assigned early on in the process.   
	
	 An administrator has the ability to create or edit territories,  entire congregations, publishers, and hopefully in the future add important congregational news updates to the publishers headers  which they can view when they've signed in.  Currently	publishers have the ability to view the congregation they belong to and sign out or return territories.  A territory that is signed out records information such as the date signed out and which publisher signed it out to the database.   Administrators then can view all of this information and keep overseers informed of any  necessary developments. 
	 
	 Eventually the goal  is to create a system that allows publishers to submit issues, improvements  or suggestions,  updates to administrators and for the administrators to add additional important information to each territory, review and implement the advantageous suggestions and to publish upcoming events or current information to the app.   I think it might take another few weeks to get it close and maybe a year to get it to not only do all these things but really have an appealing user friendly appearance.
	 
	On a personal note I had fun with this project.  I feel like I've learned a lot and yet somehow still know very very little but I'm excited to do more research and develop more skills in the field because I enjoyed this and because I have a lot of ideas.  So I see more research, more learning, more skills development, and more assistance from other developers to get this application where I'd like it to be and to where the vast majority of users find the entire process seamless.
	
****	The Apps Plan:****

1.  Get it reviewed
2.  Apply the suggestions
3.  Add Do Not Call Records, House to House Records, Street Names, Territory Images, Meeting Information and the rest of the features outlined in the database columns initially created.
4.  Get it working
5.  Make it look pretty

**The Timeframe:

March 2019

**** The Outlook:****

I'm hopeful :)
