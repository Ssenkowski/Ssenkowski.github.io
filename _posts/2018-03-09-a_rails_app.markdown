 A lot of work goes into managing territories during the year.  The RAILS_TERRITORY_APP  was designed to help administrators manage these congregation territories and to help publishers find the process of using them easy.  This was done in two simple ways
 
1.  Make territories downloadable to the publishers in the field via a web app 

2.   Allow territory administrators to track publishers efforts and the flow of territories.

Publisher's or administrator's are invited to sign up.  Following their user accoutn they are then directly linked to the publisher's new page and asked to create a publisher account that links with their user account.  This allows privileges to be assigned early on in the process.   
	
 Administrators have the ability to create and edit territories,  congregations, and individual publishers.  	Publishers have the ability to view local congregation information and sign out or return territories.  When signed out a territory records information such as the date signed out and which publisher signed it out and when it's returned.   Administrators then can view all of this information. 

 Eventually the goal  is to create a system that allows publishers to submit issues, improvements  or suggestions,  updates to administrators.  Administrators then can add additional information to each territory,  or implement  suggestions or publish upcoming events.   Honestly I don't know what the timeframe would be to get this working with more features, it's only my first Rails app.  But I think a lot of the basic leg work has been done so hopefully a few more months to get it working.

On a personal note I had fun with this project.  I feel like I've learned a lot and yet somehow still know very, very little but I'm excited to do more research and develop more skills in the field.  There's a lot left to accomplish with this app so below is the plan.

	
### The Plan:



1.  Get it reviewed
2.  Apply the suggestions
3.  Add Do Not Call Records, House to House Records, Street Names, Territory Images, Meeting Information and the rest of the features outlined in the database columns initially created.
4.  Address the bugs
5.  Make it easy to use with an appealing user interface.
6.  Run a beta version with users
7.  If approved for use publish a public version locally

### The Timeframe:



Local publishing - August 2018

Expanded use - August 2019

### The Outlook:



Optimistic
